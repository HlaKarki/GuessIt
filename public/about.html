        <h2>Guessit Wordplay</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The game is simple: you have six chances to guess a five-letter word. With each guess,
            you'll receive feedback on which letters are correct and in the correct position,
            which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the word at all.
            Using this feedback, you'll need to deduce the secret word before you run out of guesses.
        </p>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            Let's say the hidden word is "GRAPE". The player starts by guessing "APPLE".
            The game would then reveal that the letters "A" and "E" are in the hidden word, but in the wrong position.
            The player can then use this information to make a more informed guess on their next attempt, such as "ORBIT".
            The game would then reveal that the letter "R" is in the hidden word and in the correct position.
            <br>
            <br>
            The player continues to make guesses until they either correctly guess the hidden word,
            or they use up all six of their attempts. If the player correctly guesses the hidden word,
            they win the round and can move on to the next one. If they do not guess the hidden word in six attempts,
            they lose the round and the game is over.
